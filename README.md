## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Just with your knowledge

### What I learned

This project allowed me to review HTML semantics, as well as flexbox.

```css
div {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 16px;
    padding: 16px;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to do projects to improve my understanding and especially the use of JavaScript.
